## Project Overview

This quiz application was developed as a learning project to explore Flutter's capabilities for cross-platform mobile development. The primary goal was to create a functional quiz app while gaining hands-on experience with Flutter's widget system and state management.

## Motivation

I started this project to strengthen my understanding of mobile development concepts and to build a practical application that demonstrates my growing skills in Flutter. As someone interested in educational technology, I wanted to create a tool that makes learning more interactive and engaging.

## Development Goals

- Learn Flutter framework fundamentals
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Create an intuitive user interface
- Practice state management in a real-world application
- Understand the integration between Flutter and native platform code

## Current Implementation

The application currently features a basic quiz structure with multiple-choice questions. The UI is designed to be clean and user-friendly, focusing on the core functionality of presenting questions and recording answers.

## Technical Reflections

Working with Flutter has been an enlightening experience. The widget-based approach to UI construction provides great flexibility, though it required adjusting my thinking from traditional view-based frameworks. The hot reload feature significantly accelerated the development process, allowing for rapid iteration and experimentation.

The most challenging aspect was implementing proper state management across different screens while maintaining a clean architecture. I opted for a simple approach initially but plan to refactor using more advanced patterns as the project evolves.

## Future Directions

This project is still in its early stages, and I plan to expand it with:

- A wider variety of question types
- User authentication and profile management
- Performance statistics and learning analytics
- Customizable quiz categories
- Social sharing features
